All final plugin builds will be placed in this folder.

There is no "make install" process, simply copy those files to their appropriate place.

For example, LV2 plugins can go in $PREFIX/lib/lv2, or $HOME/.lv2, so to 'install' the plugins per-use do the following:

```
$ mkdir -p $HOME/.lv2
$ cp -R *.lv2 $HOME/.lv2
```

or for the whole system:

```
$ sudo mkdir -p $PREFIX/lv2
$ sudo cp -R *.lv2 $PREFIX/lv2
```
